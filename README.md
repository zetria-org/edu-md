## Purpose  
The Markdown standard provides people with an easy way to create formatted documents, without having to deal with complex structures seen in formats like Wikitext and Office XML. However, the textual nature of markdown means that it is impossible to include more complex multimedia content. In building an opensource educational platform, our team wanted to take advantage of the simplicity of Markdown yet needed to handle more diverse and complex media formats into our system. Hence, we developed this standard.  

Edu-Md is **a format that extends from the original Markdown format**, enabling more complex and multimedia content to be presented in a Markdown document.  
  
Because of the opensource nature of our platform we decided to open this standard to everyone to perhaps contribute to a more open world for educational technology.
